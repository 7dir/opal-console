* Opal Console
Opal console are develoment tools for Opal based web apps. It starts
off with an "opal console" which is a subclass of [[https://github.com/fkchang/opal-irb][opal-irb]] modified to
work as a [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opal-console/bloiggoenjaanceeabeipidehkahdcam?hl=en-US][Chrome devtool]].
Other features from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkhihHVLzQ][opal-inspector]] will be be added over time.

** Console Features
See [[http://fkchang.github.io/opal-irb/doc/presentations/opal_irb_overview.html][this article]] for a fairly comprehensive list of features.  Note
that "live gists" are not supported, unless I figure out a way to make
them work meaningful with a devtool.

* FAQ

** What Opal versions supported
Due to having to inject some code into the inspected window, only Opal 0.8 and above are currently supported
