Opal console are develoment tools for Opal based web apps. It starts
off with an "opal console" which is a subclass of [[https://github.com/fkchang/opal-irb][opal-irb]] modified to
work as a [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwithvym7_TNAhWITCYKHe5aAXUQFghKMAo&url=https%253A%252F%252Fchrome.google.com%252Fwebstore%252Fdetail%252Fopal-console%252Fbloiggoenjaanceeabeipidehkahdcam%253Fhl%253Den-US&usg=AFQjCNE94kGLD3ZegUgcd9z6TSD66C26Jg&sig2=BDJm8vtCcXI8byjIBo599w][Chrome devtool]].

Other features from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkhihHVLzQ][opal-inspector]] will be be added over time.

** Console Features
See [[http://fkchang.github.io/opal-irb/doc/presentations/opal_irb_overview.html][this article]] for a fairly comprehensive list of features.  Note
that "live gists" are not supported, unless I figure out a way to make
them work meaningful with a devtool.
